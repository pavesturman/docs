# Auto-Prompting

The SDK can automatically prompt users to share their referral link based on specific events:

```swift
// Send events from your app
Advato.shared.sendEvent("purchase_completed")

// Reset prompt cooldown if needed
Advato.shared.resetPromptCooldown()
```

Configure auto-prompting in the dashboard:

- Enable/disable the feature
- Set prompt frequency
- Customize prompt appearance
- Define trigger events
